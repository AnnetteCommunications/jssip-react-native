CHANGELOG
=========

### 3.10.0-annette
I backported changes from the fork https://github.com/rvulpescu/react-native-jssip
Changed lib/RTCSession.js to support MediaStream.addStream() function instead of addTrack(), which breaks React Native.


### INITIAL
This is a fork directly from the github repo https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP. This is the parent repo for all JSSIP development, so since I forked it from there, we will be able to pull changes from this master repo and keep this fork up to date.
